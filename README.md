</div>

A simple wrapper to deliver or schedule macOS Notifications in Rust.

## Usage

```toml
#Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
mac-notification-sys = "0.6"
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://h4llow3en.github.io/mac-notification-sys/mac_notification_sys/)

## Example

```rust
use mac_notification_sys::*;

fn main() {
    let bundle = get_bundle_identifier_or_default("firefox");
    set_application(&bundle).unwrap();

    send_notification(
        "Danger",
        Some("Will Robinson"),
        "Run away as fast as you can",
        None,
    )
    .unwrap();

    send_notification(
        "NOW",
        None,
        "Without subtitle",
        Some(Notification::new().sound("Blow")),
    )
    .unwrap();
}

```

## TODO

- [ ] Add timeout option so notifications can be auto-closed
- [ ] Allow NSDictionary to hold various types (perhaps with a union?)
- [ ] Switch to UserNotification if possible
